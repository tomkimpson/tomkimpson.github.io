## About Me

I am currently a research fellow at the [University of Melbourne](https://physics.unimelb.edu.au/) within the [Mathematics and Statistics department](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au) and [MACSYS](https://macsys.org). 

Prior to that I was a research fellow in gravitational wave astrophysics within the [Physics department](https://physics.unimelb.edu.au) as part of [OzGrav](https://www.ozgrav.org) 

Prior to _that_ I was a postdoc at the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/predictability-weather-and-climate) where I researched reduced precision arithmetic and machine learning techniques applied to [climate simulations](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1906691116).

I got my PhD in theoretical astrophysics from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), within the [Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/). During this period I also spent time at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/) as Visiting Graduate Fellow. My PhD was awarded the [Alan Johnstone Award for Outstanding Scientific Achievement](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/department/space-climate-physics-awards).

In addition to academic research, I have spent some time doing cool stuff in applied ML and data science @ [Mind Foundry](https://www.mindfoundry.ai/), [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/discover-our-company/), [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/careers) and [Pace](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pacerevenue).

## Research interests

My research interests are broad, covering mathematical biology, astrophysics and climate science.
